So the code I have changed:
samples.cc .h
analysis.cc .h
oxford.cc .h
detector.cc
oxford_sideban.cc .h
oxford_atalas_qcd .cc .h

I basically added finalState const& higgsfs to all the analysis function that is called.
Then I added some lines in the oxford.cc to test if the new code can tell if
higgs are inside the largeR jet(assuming the deltaR is 1)
